							<p>You are looking (with wonder and amazement, of course), at the official student portal of the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing <b>(IIITD&M) </b> Kancheepuram. Though we realize that you’re itching to click on all the links that you can see, here’s something you should read first. Trust us, it’s going to be worth it. It&rsquo;s a Q&amp;A format, since that&rsquo;s what we are most familiar with. </p>

							<p><b>Q. What exactly is 4pi all about? </b></p>
							
							<p><b>Note: </b>Though you’ll know soon enough, we’re going to list the most important things out, because of the teeny tiny chance that you’ll miss something. And that would be a shame.</p>
							
							<p><b>A.</b> 4pi is:</p>

							<p>1. The complete, holistic, all-encompassing information portal for you. All that you need to know, ought to know and want to know about our institute will be found here.</p>

							<p>2. A platform where ideas are shared, sparks are ignited and wonders are created, all through interaction on a platform which breaks down any barriers of accessibility and communication that existed hitherto.</p>

							<br /><br />       
							<p>3. The one stop destination for institute news and happenings. Workshops, seminars and so forth. </p>
							
							<p>4. A platform that enables you to filter out what’s relevant to you, find people whose interests match yours and collaborate to make great things happen.</p>
							
							
							
							<p><b>Q. Why do we need 4pi?</b></p>
							<p><b>A.</b> Navigate through the portal. The answer will become obvious. </p>
							
							
							
							<p><b>Q. Why should I use 4pi?</b></p>
							<p><b>A.</b> You already are. So we assume that was a rhetorical question.</p>

							<p id="aboutPara3" >Since you’ve read this till here, here’s some trivia, as a bonus.4pi is called 4pi because 4pi radians (steradian) is the angle you need to sweep, 2pi with a line and 2pi with the circle that the line makes, to get a sphere. And a sphere represents all things that are complete, whole and smooth. Like this portal. Thanks for reading.</p>
